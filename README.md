# Signal-Plotting-Using-MATLAB-GUI
I have plotted 4 various types of signals -Sine signal, Square signal, Triangular signal, Composite signal using MATLAB GUI.
This project demonstrates plotting of sine signal, square signal,triangular signal and composite signals in MATLAB.The composite signal is formed by combining sine, square, and triangular waveforms.It visually represents how multiple periodic signals can be merged into one.The project is useful for understanding signal composition and waveform analysis.
